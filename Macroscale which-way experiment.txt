Macroscale which-way experiment - G Wagenknecht - 2024

In the domain of quantum mechanics, the behavior of light, particularly lasers, often defies conventional understanding and hints at deeper, more complex mechanisms at play. This paper delves into the intriguing phenomena observed when a laser beam's photons are partially obstructed, leading to a reduction in its momentum. Remarkably, the extent of delay in the laser beam's travel varies significantly, hinting at a potential correlation between the duration of delay and multiversal potentials involved. This study explores how the laser's energy distribution, managed in discrete sections, impacts its overall behavior. Intriguingly, repeated measurements of the laser beam leads to an apparent shift in its location, a paradoxical outcome that challenges deterministic principles and suggests a non-deterministic model. This paper also examines the implications of such phenomena in the context of the double slit experiment. Here, the division of a photon's momentum and its subsequent location shift raise questions about the probability of events occurring. The study proposes a groundbreaking idea: photons possess the ability to transition from deterministic to non-deterministic states, thereby influencing the position of objects. This exploration offers a novel perspective on the fundamental nature of light and its role in the broader context of quantum mechanics. The double-slit experiment has stood as a cornerstone, illustrating the wave-particle duality of quantum entities. Traditionally confined to the microscopic scale, this experiment has fundamentally challenged our understanding of light and matter, revealing a reality that eludes classical intuition. This paper proposes a theoretical expansion of the double-slit experiment to a macroscopic scale, a venture into uncharted territory that promises to further unravel the enigmatic nature of quantum phenomena. The hypothesis central to this exploration posits that not only is such an experiment feasible, but its outcomes could reveal unprecedented effects, potentially reshaping our comprehension of quantum mechanics.

Intriguingly, this large-scale approach opens the door to novel phenomena. It suggests the possibility of actively choosing paths for quantum particles, an action that defies the established principle of quantum indeterminacy. This capability could unveil new paradoxes, perhaps akin to or even beyond the perplexity of Schrödinger’s Cat, where macroscopic objects exhibit quantum superposition. Furthermore, the paper delves into the theoretical realms of quantum teleportation, transcending the transmission of information to hypothesize about the teleportation of macroscopic states. This bold assertion, if feasible, would not only challenge the current confines of quantum theory but could revolutionize our understanding of space, time, and matter.

Our exploration is rooted in a rigorous theoretical and experimental framework, drawing upon the principles of quantum mechanics while pushing its boundaries. We also consider the technological and experimental challenges inherent in scaling the double-slit experiment, evaluating the feasibility with current and foreseeable advancements in quantum experimentation. This paper aims to contribute a visionary perspective to quantum mechanics, and a reexamination of what is possible within this already mysterious and intriguing field.

In various experimental observations it is theorized that upon unblocking of a monochromatic energy beams in one dimension in an oscillatory manner results in fluctuation in momentum of the energy beam, with varying potentials, repeated splitting of a wave of energy in one dimension the energy wave recovers and caused a visible relativistic curve. Varied unblocking, entangled wavefunction collapse and subsequent momentum variation indicates randomisation is time based and indicates a phenomenon of an escape from deterministic behavior rather than absolute determinism of preset randomisation. 


In conclusion, this exploration into the behavior of monochromatic light, specifically laser beams, illuminates the complex and often counterintuitive nature of quantum physics. The study reveals that when lasers encounter partial photon obstruction, they not only slow down but also exhibit variable delay potentials, underscoring a possible link between delay duration and quantum or multiversal potentials. This finding challenges the traditional deterministic view of physics, suggesting instead a nuanced, non-deterministic multiverse model.
